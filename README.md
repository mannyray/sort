# SORT

This repository contains code for the Simple Online Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. 

The Java implementation was successfully used [here](https://szonov.com/programming/2021/03/28/prototype/).

To get started please see documentation in `python_implementation/README.md` and `python_implementation/example/README.md`. After, please see `java_implementation/README.md`. The Java implementation is a translation of the Python implementation. The implementation of SORT relies on the Kalman Filter. Go [here](https://github.com/mannyray/KalmanFilter) to learn more about the Kalman Filter.


Implementation based on
